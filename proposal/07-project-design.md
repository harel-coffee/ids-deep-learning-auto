### Rubrics

Student summarizes a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Discussion is made as to what 
strategies may be employed, what analysis of the data might be required, or which algorithms will be considered. 
The workflow and discussion provided align with the qualities of the project. Small visualizations, pseudocode, or 
diagrams are encouraged but not required.

## Project Design

The project will have a typical ML Project workflow 

1. Explore the Dataset
2. Preprocess data
    1. Identify features that need log transformation and apply transformation
    2. Perform minmax scaling on numerical features
    3. Identify outliers if any
    4. One hot encode categorical features
    5. Perform Feature selection / Dimensionality Reduction as required
3. Train a variety of classifiers on the given dataset.
4. Compare results with the benchmark results.
5. Iterate and Fine-tune hyper-parameters to improve the accuracy and FAR.
6. Analyse confusion matrix and suggest future areas of improvements.
