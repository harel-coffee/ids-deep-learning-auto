### Rubrics

Student clearly describes a solution to the problem. The solution is applicable to the project 
domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, the solution is quantifiable, 
measurable, and replicable.

## Solution Statement

When an IDS uses filters and signatures to describe attack patterns, the analysis is static. This method of IDS is
called signature detection (or Misuse Based Network Intrusion Detection System (MNIDS)). Signature detection 
is limited to the detection of known attack patterns. For the detection of unknown attacks,
heuristic methods must be used. Systems that use these methods offer the possibility of detecting 
patterns that are not `normal'. These detection methods are called anomaly detection 
(Anomaly Based Network Intrusion Detection System (ANIDS)).

Machine learning can be applied in ANIDS systems. One potential solution could be, self-learning systems that learns by 
monitoring network traffic and differentiates between normal and anomalous traffic. In addition, machine learning
solutions can detect possible attacks in real time, so that combating measures can be taken in a timely manner.


The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning Model that can be used as part of an 
Intrusion Detection System.
