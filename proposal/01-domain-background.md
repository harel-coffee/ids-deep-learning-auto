## Domain Background

In recent years, human society's dependency on Information and Communication Technologies has grown leaps and bound. 
Same time, sophisticated and diverse threats to modern computer networks and systems is also increasing. 
This calls for robust security mechanism and Intrusion detection systems in place to identify and combat 
malicious activities on computer networks.  

I work for Capital One's API Platform. I am curious to apply the Machine Learning Knowledge that 
I have gained in this Nano Degree Course to the benefit of the Platform. Network Anomaly Detection is 
one of the Machine Learning use cases identified in the platform. I choose this domain 
for my capstone project, so i can take back my learning and research work and benefit the platform.
